This project utilizes semaphore and synchronization logic to simulate a Customer-Bank Teller relation across multiple
threads. I anticipate that implementing the semaphores wouldn't be too hard, but getting them to properly sync up and
output might cause some issues.

Work on the customer and teller classes have been going relatively smooth, testing is still not possible in its current
state since the classes are unfinished. I still foresee that synchronization will be a hassle come testing phase, but
we'll see.
